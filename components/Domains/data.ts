  {title: "E-commerce", body: "E-commerce was one of the first fields I professionally worked in. As an online shopper, it is likely the domain I interact with most. My first e-commerce application was a B2B2C platform called Raena, designed for an Indonesian company. It was built with React Native and TypeScript and deployed via Appcenter. They provided us with a minimum viable product (MVP), and we had two months to make it stable and ready for market for their first release. We exceeded their expectations. Two key achievements during this project were integrating a payment flow using Xendit’s SDK and redesigning the homepage to be configurable from an admin panel. This involved rearranging items on the home screen and updating existing components. We utilized a web application from Xendit for the order flow, which was 30% more expensive than their SDK. The ability to dynamically change the homepage increased user engagement by 40%. My team also refactored the codebase to enhance performance and usability. This included replacing animations with the Reanimated library to utilize native animation threads instead of relying on the main JavaScript thread. Additionally, we reduced startup time by nearly 1.5 seconds through lazy loading API calls and assets. Furthermore, we reduced APK size by approximately 40% by refactoring the code, removing unused or replaceable external libraries, and compressing images into smaller formats."},
  {title: "Fintech", body: "My initial venture into the fintech industry was with Nanovest, a cryptocurrency and stock exchange application tailored for the Indonesian market. The platform was developed using React Native and TypeScript. By the time we secured their client partnership, Nanovest had amassed approximately 50,000 monthly users. Notably, within a short time, their user base surged to nearly one million monthly users.The application’s deployment was orchestrated through CircleCI. Nanovest’s primary business objective was to establish itself as one of the pioneering companies offering a user-friendly platform for purchasing US stocks and cryptocurrencies. Upon our engagement, the product was in a state of rapid growth. Consequently, we were tasked with incorporating new features while simultaneously enhancing code structure and quality. Additionally, there were instances of production crashes that necessitated immediate rectification. On certain occasions, we would remain dedicated until 4 am, engaged in debugging release builds. \n\nThrough collaborative efforts with their core team, we successfully transformed the project into an exceptionally organized entity. This transformation encompassed not only the quality of the code but also the development, testing, and release processes. By the conclusion of our engagement, I held the leadership role in the mobile development of a specific feature and was one of the three individuals responsible for approving pull requests before their integration."},
