  {title: "E-commerce", body: "E-commerce was one of the first domains I ever worked on in a professional capacity. As an online shopper it is probably the domain I interact with the most. My first ecommerce app was a B2B2C app that was designed for an Indonesian company built on React Native and Typescript and deployed using Appcenter. They came to us with an MVP app they had and we had to get it stable and ready for market for their first app release in 2 months. We reached the clients expectation and more. I had two crowning achievement while I worked on the app, one was building a payment flow into the app using Xendit's SDK and the other was redesigning the homepage to make it configurble from an admin panel. That included rearranging the items on the homescreen as well as changing componenets already on it. We were using a webapp from Xendit to complete our order flow, which was 30% more expensive than using their SDK. The ability to dynamically change the homepage resulted in a 40% bump in app usage time for users. My team and I also had to refactor the code base to increase the apps performance and usability. This included replace existing animations with reanimated to use the native animation threads instead of the main javascript thread. We were also able to decrease start up time by almost 1.5 secs by lazy loading various API calls and asset fetches. We also reduced the APK size by about 40% by refactoring the code base, removing unused or easily replacable external libraries and compressing images into smaller formats."},
